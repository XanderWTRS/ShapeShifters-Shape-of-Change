# Shapeshifters: Shape of Change

**Shapeshifters: Shape of Change** is a 2D puzzle platformer game developed using Java and the LibGDX framework. In this game, you control a shapeshifting character with multiple forms that enable you to solve puzzles and navigate through dynamic environments. The game features platforming mechanics and a variety of challenges to overcome.

## Features

- **Shapeshifting Mechanic**: Switch between different forms to solve puzzles and interact with the environment.
- **Dynamic Environments**: Explore varied environments with hazards and obstacles that require your shapeshifting abilities.
- **Tile-based World**: The game world is designed with tilemaps for easy manipulation and varied levels.
- **Puzzle Design**: Solve platforming puzzles that challenge your understanding of the shapeshifting mechanic.
- **Core Levels**: Progress through a series of levels with increasing difficulty and complexity.
- **Sound and Music**: Atmospheric sound effects and background music to enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Conveyor Belts and Moving Tiles**: Special tiles like conveyor belts add additional puzzle complexity.
- **Multiplayer Support (Planned)**: Future updates will include multiplayer modes to allow players to compete or cooperate.

## Game Mechanics

- **Shapeshifting Forms**: Your character can transform into different shapes, each with unique abilities. These forms are necessary to overcome specific obstacles and puzzles in each level.
- **Conveyor Belts**: Moving tiles like conveyor belts push the player or interact with objects, adding another layer of strategy.
- **Fragile and Sticky Tiles**: Special tiles either break under pressure or cause the player to stick, influencing puzzle solving.
